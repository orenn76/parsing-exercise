## Question 1 - Parse Invoice Numbers

Given an input text file of 7-segment invoice numbers, the program outputs a text file with the parsed invoice numbers. It handles illegal digits by replacing illegal digits with a ? and adding a second column indicator ILLEGAL.

Input files used in this program:  
[input_Q1a.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/input_Q1a.txt)  
[input_Q1b.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/input_Q1b.txt)

Output files examples, generated by the program:  
[output_Q1a.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/test/resources/output_Q1a.txt)  
[output_Q1b.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/test/resources/output_Q1b.txt)

## Question 2 - Words Counter

The program receives a few text files and counts (and later prints) all the words that exist in these files (together) and the number of times each one of them appears.  
The implementation class contains a single map that will hold the words and the number of items of each. Each file should be handled in separate threads (in parallel).    
*Note: When splitting the text into separate words, there is no dealing with special characters such as “,.-:” etc.*

Input files used in this program:  
[file1.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/file1.txt)  
[file2.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/file2.txt)  
[file3.txt](https://github.com/orenn76/parsing-exercise/tree/master/src/main/resources/file3.txt)
